    <h2>A Small introduction</h2>

    <p>Hai To Everyone Reading This . I Am Abdul Sameeu currently studying as an Engineering Student at KMEA Engineering
        College Kochi.So i have always been a fan of the internet well who isnt right? and learning how to create those
        fancy websites was in my bucket list for a long but during the start of the academic year managing all those
        assignment and keeping up with the lab stuff meant that my aim to study web dev had to be paused . Well after
        all those assignment saga finally i heard about this bootcamp event well the one thing that made me register to
        this event was it was held as an offline event .
